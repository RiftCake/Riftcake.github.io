        <h1>Biography</h1>
  <h2> Childhood</h2>
    <p>When I was born my parents were divorced and I was raised by my grandparents. Both my parents at this time were addicted to alcohol and drugs and I was forced to grow up around that. With all of this going on around me it felt like I had no one there for me yet my grandparents in this time really showed me that i could count on them for anything and everything. They got custody of me and showed me how a real family should be. However my mother she was not the best mom ever after I was born she never held a job for any longer then 2 months so she moved in and out of my grandparents house. This was not a good thing for me as whenever she came into the house she always promised me that she would get clean of everything and that she is getting better but everytime that she promised these she lied and broke these promises and it has gotten to about 34 lies by now. Because of this I have lost full trust in her and I have learned who to trust and who not to trust. My father i saw him every other weekend and he sold drugs to try to raise me but he didn't just sell them he also used them for a long time to where whenever i went over there i was scared to even be there (He is clean now and our relationship is getting better). My childhood was like this till about the 6th grade and it was some of the worst time of my life
        </p>
    <h2>Middle - High School</h2>
        <p>This is around the 6th grade and i've just started the 4th year of wrestling. This time my family life is getting pretty better and i’ve started to think about the future to try to figure out what i want to do. Honestly what I wanted to be is nothing close to where I am now. I wanted to be a chef or a firefighter but as i kept going through my years of school the dream to be a firefighter went away and i started to pursue the dream of being a chef by joining the cooking programs my school had to offer. I went to different cooking competitions and did pretty well in them ( I was even offered a half ride to the Culinary Institute of America) Yet around this time I was turned away of the idea of becoming a chef for the sole reason that they don’t get holidays off. Around this time is when me and my dad started to reconnect slowly as he got cleaner and better but for my mom she has yet to even try to get better and is still lying to me. But while in high school I joined two classes that could progress my future Welding and Computer Science. I got pretty good in welding and even got certified in some processes and I was dead set on doing that and just picking up some computer skills so i could do some work at home on my computer. However my teacher Mr.Law had different plans for me as he sent me a email about a Computer internship called NexTech Catapult. So i signed up and had a interview and next thing I knew i was walking in on the first day
            </p>
    <h2>The Present</h2>
        <p>Right when I walked into the doors of the Speak Easy I felt right at home and relaxed. The second day I ( as Jill said “Bursted through the wall as she was walking to open the door to my future”) I jumped straight into everything and got myself a interview at the school Kenzie Academy which is a computer school where I enrolled for their software engineering program and about a week later I got the acceptance from them and I knew that this is what I want to do for my future. I knew that I made it and what I wanted to do when I got myself into a school where the acceptance rate is 18%. With this I know that i have made my grandparents proud of me.
